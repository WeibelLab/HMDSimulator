# The virtual-augmented reality simulator

When developing AR applications for high-precision domains such as surgery, we face a common problem: how can the system guarantee that the end-user will see a virtual object aligned with its real-world counterpart? Alignment, or registration, is a crucial feature of AR displays, but achieving accurate alignment between real and virtual objects is not trivial. With hundreds of calibration approaches available, we need better tools to understand how and when calibration algorithms fail as well as understand what can be done to improve alignment. This work introduces a novel AR simulator in VR that facilitates experimentation with different calibration algorithms.

# Getting started
We recommend cloning the repository and playing the test scenes; to help you navigate the existing source code, we have put together some documents:
- [Core Assets](Documents/Core%20Assets%20Document.md) for a brief explanation of the code structure.
- [Setting up the environment](Documents/Guide%20Document.md): a tutorial on how to set it up from scratch on PCVR
- [Oculus Quest Tutorial](Documents/Guide%20Document%20Oculus%20Ver.md): a tutorial on how to set it up from scratch for Oculus Quest
